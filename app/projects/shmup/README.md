A shooter game based on Phaser framework

[PLAY IT! >](http://chmood.github.io/shmup/dist/)

## CONCEPT

__RPG rogue-like retro shoot'em up__

## FEATURES

* procedural background terrain
* rich enemy shoot patterns

## TODO'S

* rich player shoot patterns (multiple streams, lateral pods, auto-aiming streams, homing missiles)
* better flying enemy spawn patterns
* proportional upgrades

##Â KNOWN BUGS

* Massive enemy shoot salves (seems capped, by the pool ?)
* endless scroll : seemless loop (offset bug + tileable/infinite terrain generation)
* terrain smoothing : fairly biased (especially on x axis)

## Credits

Profund greetings to Open Tyrian graphics (sprites, tilemaps). Helped me a lot to prototype fast.
